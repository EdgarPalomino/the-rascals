Project Name: The Rascals

Project Description: A small website that I created to host my video piece "The Rascals" (which I amde wiht my classmates Mudi Alkhaaldi, Jun Lee and Ahsen Saaim). The overall concept of the website involves having two web pages: a simple opening page where the user is shown a black notebook that they can click to "read" and a more elaborate main page where the user can explore the "contents" of one of the pages of the black notebook. The overall theme of the website is based around the aesthetics of a scrapbook, as this helps to complement and enhance the emo/punk feeling of the video piece. In general, I tried my best to create an interactive experience for the visitors of my "The Rascals" website.

Process: In order to implement my overall concept for the website, I included many different HTML events in both of its web pages. In the opening page, the image of the black notebook is placed in the middle of the screen, and while the user is hovering over it with their mouse, a speech bubble saying "Click to read me!" appears on the right side of the screen. Then, when the user clicks the image of the black notebook, the main page is loaded (with an animation to make the opening page fade-out). In the main page, the video piece is placed in the middle of the screen as a YouTube embedded link, and all around it, there are "stickers" that the user can click to explore the "contents" of the notebook. When the user clicks a "slate sticker", a small tab containing a blooper video appears next to it and the rest of the screen is blurred, and when the user clicks an "object sticker", a speech bubble containing some information about the video piece appears next to it. Apart from this, there are "subscribe" and "download" buttons that take the user to the YouTube channel of Bring Me The Horizon and download an MP3 version of "Can You Feel My Heart".

Reflection/Evaluation: In general, I would say that my website did vary a lot from its initial concept to its final implementation. For example, the first idea I had with my classmates involved making a behind-the-scenes documentary about the projects of the other groups in our class. But shortly afterwards, we scraped off this idea and decided to make instead a video telling the story of a group of friends who want to form a band. However, while we were working on recording the shots for our video piece, we thought that making a music video would overall be a more creative idea, so we decided to make a parody music video of the song "Can You Feel My Heart" by Bring Me The Horizon. We then changed this idea a bit and decided to add opening and closing scenes to give the visitor some "backstory" on the creation of the music video. But in the end, I am happy and proud that me and my classmates could fulfill the final vision that we had for our website and that we could create a cool and engaging video piece.
